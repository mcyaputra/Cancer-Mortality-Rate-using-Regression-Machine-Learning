## üìù Description
Hi All!

Linear regression is a supervised machine learning algorithm used to predict the value of a dependant variable based on one or several independent variables. In this project, the dependant variable is the cancer mortality rate, we will utilize US census dataset containing information and independent features of multiple counties in the US to predict the mortality rate caused by cancer. 

There are a lot of literatures and studies on linear regression such as how data should be structured to best train the models and maximize the accuracy of the prediction outcomes. In this opportunity, we will use CRISP-DM framework to provide a more structured approach to tackle this project, properly documents every step taken and stay focused and organized on our objectives throughout the process.

Six major phases of CRISP-DM:

1. Business Understanding
2. Data Understanding
3. Data Preparation
4. Modelling
5. Evaluation
6. Deployment

Detailed report based on CRISP-DM can be found [here](/project_summary.docx)

We will run 3 experiments:

Experiment 1: [Univariate linear regression](/Univariate_Linear_Regression.ipynb)
Univariate linear regression using 2 features with higher correlation with the target variable (cancer mortality rate). The purpose is to see if we can accurately predict mortality rate using single variable.

Experiment 2: Multivariate linear regression
Multivariate linear regression using all the available features in the dataset. The objective is to see how well the model performs if we all the features available.

Experiment 3: Multivariate linear regression
Regularization and feature engineering are used to try to achieve better accuracy compared to previous experiments.
